# Ztyle

Bunch of CSS classes.

`Ztyle` is not intended to be a small css library, the main goal the team follows is to have all minimum needed classes to build a project with almost no extra `CSS`.

The minified compiled output is a `~14mb` file. Loading the full `styles.css` or `styles.min.css` can result in a very bad practice to your project. You should **ALWAYS** use a treeshake-css tool.
